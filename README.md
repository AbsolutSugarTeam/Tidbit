===========
Tidbit is random data generator for SugarCRM versions 5.5 and later.  By optimizing
the communications with the database, large amounts of data can be inserted
into the system for testing without manual intervention.

Requirements
------------

SugarCRM Already installed

Installation
------------
To install Tidbit, unpack the Tidbit-v###.tar.bz2 file, and place the Tidbit/
directory within your SugarCRM installation (Tidbit Directory need to be created inside SugarCRM Installation folder).

The only requirement of Tidbit is that you have an installed and properly
configured copy of SugarCRM in the directory above it.
